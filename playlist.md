# Music playlist

In the experiment, background music was played on the participantsâ€™ headphones because the noise-canceling alone did not cancel the vibration feedback. A second computer is used to connect to the second headphone over Bluetooth (one set of headphones per laptop). The playlist consists of royalty free music and is provided below. It is longer then needed for the experiment just in case, the playlist is started from the top when the experiment starts (after the training trials).
