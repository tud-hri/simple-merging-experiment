This website contains the online supplementary materials accompanying the papers: "Human Merging Behaviour in a Coupled Driving Simulator; How do we resolve conflicts?" and "A model of dyadic merging interactions explains human drivers’ behavior from control inputs to decisions". It includes interactive versions of plots in the papers, plus extra plots and videos.
