<h1>A model of dyadic merging interactions explains human drivers' behavior from control inputs to decisions</h1>

<h3>Welcome</h3>

This webpage contains the supplementary videos to the paper "A model of dyadic merging interactions explains human drivers' behavior from control inputs to decisions" by Olger Siebinga, Arkady Zgonnikov, and David Abbink. The written supplementary materials can be found [here](documents/supplementary materials model paper.pdf). The videos shown here are screen captures taken from the playback script included in the software accompanying the paper. These playbacks can easily be opened using the published software and data, for links to the repositories click the "About" button (right-top corner of the page).

<h3>Typical merging interactions</h3>
Below are two videos that show typical merging interaction of the model and human participants. These videos show the first occurrence of the neutral condition (0_0) for pair 1. The pane on the left side of the screen shows a top-down view representing what the experimenter saw during the experiment. Participants saw a zoomed-in version of this top-down view (the playback script allows zooming). Below the top-down view are two speed dials. These dials represent the velocities of the left and right vehicle with respect to their average velocity (10 m\s), denoted by the green bar. On the right-hand side, the top plot shows the velocity traces of the red and the blue vehicles. The vertical dotted line indicates the current time. For a detailed explanation of  the other two plots, please see [Siebinga et al. (2022)](https://doi.org/10.54941/ahfe1002485).

<h3>Collisions</h3>
Below are two examples of collisions that occurred, one with human participants and one with the model. Both videos were taken from pair 1, but with different experimental conditions. See the written [supplementary materials](documents/supplementary materials model paper.pdf) for a more extended discussion on the collisions that occurred and a full list of the participant pair and trial numbers of all trials that ended in a collision. These videos both fall in the category "Drivers take the same action".
