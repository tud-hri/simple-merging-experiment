<h1>A model of dyadic merging interactions explains human drivers' behavior from control inputs to decisions</h1>

<h3>Welcome</h3>

This webpage contains the supplementary videos to the paper "A model of dyadic merging interactions explains human drivers' behavior from control inputs to decisions" by Olger Siebinga, Arkady Zgonnikov, and David Abbink. The written supplementary materials can be found [here](documents/supplementary materials model paper.pdf). The videos shown here are screen captures taken from the playback script included in the software accompanying the paper. These playbacks can easily be opened using the published software and data, for links to the repositories click the "About" button (right-top corner of the page).

<h3>Typical merging interactions</h3>
Below are two videos that show typical merging interaction of the model and human participants. These videos show the first occurrence of the neutral condition (0_0) for pair 1. The pane on the left side of the screen shows a top-down view representing what the experimenter saw during the experiment. Participants saw a zoomed-in version (the playback script allows zooming). The top plot on the right hand side shows the velocity profiles of the red and the blue vehicles. For a detailed explanation of  the other two plots, please see [Siebinga et al. (2022)](https://doi.org/10.54941/ahfe1002485).
